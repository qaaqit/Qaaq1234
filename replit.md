# QaaqConnect PatalAtlantic - Next-Generation Maritime Platform

## Overview
QaaqConnect PatalAtlantic is the evolution of maritime networking platforms (beyond MARIANA, Patalbase, and PatalPacific). It provides a seamless experience for maritime professionals to explore global port networks, access AI-powered assistance via QBOT, and connect with authenticated industry peers through secure messaging. The platform features robust multi-layer authentication (Google OAuth, Replit Auth, JWT), real-time communication, and enhanced stability. Its business vision is to be the leading maritime platform connecting global port networks and industry professionals, focusing on authenticated maritime professionals, shipping companies, and port authorities worldwide.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Username field label: "USER NAME (This may be ur Email or country code & whatsapp number )"
Primary focus: "Koi Hai?" (Who's there?) discovery - helping sailors find who's nearby in ports
Home page after login: QBOT Chat (not Map Radar) - users land on QBOT Chat immediately after authentication
MARIANA BASE RULE: The app will NEVER carry out bulk assignment of users to rank groups - this functionality is permanently disabled for security
Color Scheme: Orange, cream, and white maritime professional palette - consistent across all platform interfaces.
Search Interface: Crown icon must be present in search bar, filter/map/radar icons on right side of search bar
Header Design: White header with QAAQ logo, admin shield, and QBOT button
Map display: Full screen with light grey theme initially, becomes colorful when user searches
Map behavior: Shows empty grey map on load, displays pins only when "Koi Hai?" button is pressed
Proximity feature: Shows nearest 10 users when searching without text input
Connected to QAAQ parent database - contains 948+ authentic maritime professionals with real profile data
Scope Focus: Core "Koi Hai?" discovery functionality - CPSS navigation and social features removed from roadmap
Active Conversations section completely removed - only Top Q Professionals cards remain in compact format (6 cards per screen)
Mobile Optimization: Responsive layout with touch-friendly controls and compact design
Enhanced Search: Updated placeholder to "Sailors/ Ships/ Company" for better user guidance
Admin shield location: Keep admin shield in header top right corner (not in bottom navigation)
Header visibility: Show white header only for admin users, regular users should not see the header
Premium mode: Crown icon in search box toggles premium Google Maps features, requires premium plan for non-admin users
WhatsApp Bot: Moved from map overlay to header button next to logout for cleaner map interface
Google Maps Controls: Transparent icon-only buttons positioned in bottom-left corner (Road/Satellite/Hybrid view toggles), zoom controls (+ and - buttons) positioned in top-right corner below map maximize box
Home Reset Button: Red "Home" button in top-left corner resets search, filters, and returns to base map view
User Card Interactions: Profile photo circles are clickable for chat, clicking card body centers map on user location
Onboard Search: Special "onboard" keyword search filters for sailing users and displays ship name & IMO number prominently
Shipping Dictionary Access: Users can access maritime dictionary definitions without authentication
Login Roadblock Design: Single minimizable login roadblock with chevron control in top-right corner, no separate roadblocks for individual features
Breadcrumb positioned next to back arrow as small text in one line, code cards positioned in top-left corner with back arrow above
Enhanced Reorder System: Admin reorder modals now feature editable code cards allowing direct code modification alongside position changes for comprehensive hierarchy management. Simplified reorder buttons use only RotateCcw icon without text or colored backgrounds for cleaner interface.
S>E>M>M hierarchical structure where System=Great Grandfather, Equipment=Grandfather, Make=Father, Model=Son. CRITICAL RULE: All transfers must move complete family units - Equipment moves with ALL its Makes+Models, Make moves with ALL its Models. No Model exists without parent Make, no Make without parent Equipment. They are inseparable hardbound families that must always move together during any SEMM operations.
