# QaaqConnect Mariana - Maritime Community Platform

## Overview
QaaqConnect is a comprehensive maritime networking platform designed to enhance shore leaves, simplify shopping for sailors, and facilitate social connections. It enables sailors to discover nearby peers and locals, access a curated marketplace for maritime essentials, and engage in location-based discussions. The platform aims to foster an authentic maritime community experience by integrating proximity-based user discovery, real-time location mapping, direct communication tools, and a structured content navigation system.

Business Vision: To be the leading platform for maritime professionals, fostering genuine connections and simplifying life at sea and ashore.
Market Potential: Tapping into the global maritime industry, connecting a vast network of sailors, ship companies, and related businesses.
Project Ambitions: To create a vibrant, self-sustaining community where maritime professionals can thrive personally and professionally.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Username field label: "USER NAME (This may be ur country code +91 & whatsapp number )"
Primary focus: "Koi Hai?" (Who's there?) discovery - helping sailors find who's nearby in ports
Home page after login: QBOT Chat (not Map Radar) - users land on QBOT Chat immediately after authentication
MARIANA BASE RULE: The app will NEVER carry out bulk assignment of users to rank groups - this functionality is permanently disabled for security
ðŸ”’ PROFILE FIELD REMOVAL: current_ship_imo field permanently removed from profile form and backend - not needed per user request (August 2025)
Color Scheme: Orange, cream, and white colors only - NO red, blue, purple, green or dark colors. All SEMM pages use consistent orange accent colors matching parent app branding.
Search Interface: Crown icon must be present in search bar, filter/map/radar icons on right side of search bar
Header Design: White header with QAAQ logo, admin shield, and QBOT button
Map display: Full screen with light grey theme initially, becomes colorful when user searches
Map behavior: Shows empty grey map on load, displays pins only when "Koi Hai?" button is pressed
Proximity feature: Shows nearest 10 users when searching without text input
User data: Connected to QAAQ parent database - contains 948+ authentic maritime professionals with real profile data
Scope Focus: Core "Koi Hai?" discovery functionality - CPSS navigation and social features removed from roadmap
ðŸ”’ QH13 FORMAT UPDATED: Active Conversations section completely removed - only Top Q Professionals cards remain in compact format (6 cards per screen)
ðŸ”’ DUAL SEARCH SYSTEM LOCKED: Pull-to-search on QH13 page + Q radar map search both fully operational with clickable green dots and DM navigation
Mobile Optimization: Responsive layout with touch-friendly controls and compact design
Enhanced Search: Updated placeholder to "Sailors/ Ships/ Company" for better user guidance
Admin shield location: Keep admin shield in header top right corner (not in bottom navigation)
Header visibility: Show white header only for admin users, regular users should not see the header
Premium mode: Crown icon in search box toggles premium Google Maps features, requires premium plan for non-admin users
WhatsApp Bot: Moved from map overlay to header button next to logout for cleaner map interface
Google Maps Controls: Transparent icon-only buttons positioned in bottom-left corner (Road/Satellite/Hybrid view toggles)
Home Reset Button: Red "Home" button in top-left corner resets search, filters, and returns to base map view
User Card Interactions: Profile photo circles are clickable for chat, clicking card body centers map on user location
Onboard Search: Special "onboard" keyword search filters for sailing users and displays ship name & IMO number prominently
Shipping Dictionary Access: Users can access maritime dictionary definitions without authentication
Login Roadblock Design: Single minimizable login roadblock with chevron control in top-right corner, no separate roadblocks for individual features
ðŸ”’ SEMM LAYOUT REDESIGN: Breadcrumb positioned next to back arrow as small text in one line, code cards positioned in top-left corner with back arrow above
Enhanced Reorder System: Admin reorder modals now feature editable code cards allowing direct code modification alongside position changes for comprehensive hierarchy management. Simplified reorder buttons use only RotateCcw icon without text or colored backgrounds for cleaner interface.
