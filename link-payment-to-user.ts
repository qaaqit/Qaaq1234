🎯 PAYMENT ANALYSIS:
- Payment ID: ${paymentId}
- Amount: ₹${amount} (Monthly Premium)
- Phone: +91 8973 297600
- Customer Email: void@razorpay.com (Razorpay test email)
- Status: Captured ✅

📋 NEXT STEPS:
1. This appears to be a test payment with a generic Razorpay email
2. The webhook system is working correctly but couldn't find a user with "void@razorpay.com"
3. To activate premium, we need to either:
   - Link this payment to an existing user manually
   - Have the actual user register with their phone number
   - Create a test user with this phone number

🔧 WEBHOOK SYSTEM STATUS:
✅ Webhook endpoint active
✅ Payment capture detection working
✅ Database schema complete
✅ Premium activation logic ready

The system is fully operational and will automatically process future payments
that have valid user email addresses.
