## 10-Step WorkShip Marketplace Implementation

### Step 1: Database Schema Design - Simplified Approach
**Goal**: Create streamlined database tables leveraging existing user system
**Core Principle**: Every User Can Be a Service Provider - No separate provider registration needed

**1. workshop_services Table (Simplified)**
Services offered by users (acting as companies)
- id: varchar (UUID, Primary Key)
- userId: varchar (Foreign Key to users.id - the provider)
- serviceTitle: text (e.g., "Engine Overhaul", "Hull Repair")
- serviceCategory: text (mechanical, electrical, hull, etc.)
- semmSystemCode: text (links to SEMM equipment type)
- Three-Tier Pricing:
  - baseShiftRate: real (8-hour shift rate in USD)
  - overtimeHourlyRate: real (per hour rate)
  - travelHourlyRate: real (travel time rate)
- Service Info:
  - description: text
  - portsCovered: text[] (array of ports they serve)
  - responseTime: integer (hours to respond)
  - isActive: boolean
  - createdAt: timestamp

**2. workshop_bookings Table (Simplified)**
Anonymous booking system to prevent disintermediation
- id: varchar (UUID, Primary Key)
- bookingCode: text (anonymous reference like "WS-2024-001")
- serviceId: varchar (Foreign Key to workshop_services.id)
- providerId: varchar (hidden from ship manager)
- shipManagerId: varchar (Foreign Key to users.id)
- Service Details:
  - shipName: text
  - imoNumber: text
  - portLocation: text
  - requestedDate: date
  - serviceDescription: text
- Pricing:
  - totalHours: real
  - overtimeHours: real
  - travelHours: real
  - totalAmount: real
- Status:
  - status: text ('requested', 'quoted', 'confirmed', 'completed')
  - createdAt: timestamp

**3. workshop_messages Table**
Anonymous communication channel
- id: varchar (UUID, Primary Key)
- bookingId: varchar (Foreign Key to workshop_bookings.id)
- senderRole: text ('provider' or 'shipmanager')
- message: text
- createdAt: timestamp
Note: No user IDs exposed - only roles

**4. workshop_reviews Table (Optional)**
Anonymous feedback system
- id: varchar (UUID, Primary Key)
- bookingId: varchar
- rating: integer (1-5)
- review: text
- createdAt: timestamp
Note: Reviews display as "Workshop Provider #123" not actual names

**Key Privacy Features:**
- Provider Anonymity: Ship managers see services as "Workshop WS-001" not company names
- Existing User Integration: No new registration needed - users just add services
