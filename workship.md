# WorkShip Maritime Marketplace - 10 Step Implementation Process

## Current Data Analysis

### Data Sources Found:
1. **Discovery Page** (`/discover`) - Currently shows hardcoded port data with workshop "coming soon" feature
2. **CPSS Navigator** - Uses mock data structure with hierarchical organization (Country > Port > Suburb > Service)
3. **SEMM System** - Real data fetched from `/api/dev/semm-cards` for ship equipment/systems
4. **No Workshop Data** - Currently no workshop-specific database tables or booking functionality exists

### Current Workshop Feature:
- Located in `/discover` page with placeholder "Repair Workshop feature Coming soon"
- Shows major ports (Shanghai, Singapore, Rotterdam, etc.) on an interactive map
- Has port and system selection dropdowns but no actual workshop booking functionality
- Uses SEMM data for system selection but no workshop provider data
